Dog goes woof, cat goes meow
Bird goes tweet and mouse goes squeak
Cow goes moo, the frog goes croak
and the elephant goes toot

Ducks say quack and fish go blub
and the seal goes ow, ow, ow
But there’s one sound that no one knows

What the fox say?

Big blue eyes, pointy nose
Chasing mice and digging holes
Tiny paws, up the hill
Suddenly you’re standing still

Your fur is red, so beautiful
Like an angel in disguise
But if you meet a friendly horse
Will you communicate by
mo-o-o-o-orse?

What does the fox say?

The secret of the fox, ancient mystery
Somewhere deep in the woods I know you’re hiding
What is your sound? Will we ever know?
Will always be a mystery, what do you say?
You’re my guardian angel, hiding in the woods
What is your sound?
